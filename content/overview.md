## What is PMP?

PMP (Poor Man's Platform) is an open-source ecosystem that brings enterprise-grade platform capabilities to teams of all sizes. Instead of paying for expensive proprietary solutions or spending months building infrastructure from scratch, PMP offers a curated collection of integrated tools that work together seamlessly.

### Key Benefits

- **🚀 Fast Setup** - Get your platform up and running in hours, not months
- **💰 Cost-Effective** - Open-source solutions that save you thousands in licensing fees
- **🔧 Flexible** - Use what you need, customize what you want
- **📚 Well-Documented** - Each component comes with comprehensive documentation
- **🔄 Integrated** - All applications are designed to work together seamlessly
- **👥 Community-Driven** - Built and maintained by developers, for developers

### How It Works

PMP provides modular applications that cover essential platform needs:

1. **Infrastructure Management** - Tools for deployment, monitoring, and scaling
2. **Developer Experience** - CI/CD, documentation, and collaboration tools
3. **Data & Analytics** - Storage, processing, and visualization solutions
4. **Security & Compliance** - Authentication, authorization, and audit logging
5. **Communication** - Team chat, notifications, and integrations

Each application is standalone but designed to integrate with others in the ecosystem, giving you the flexibility to adopt what you need when you need it.
